# Pefile.js

Pure javascript implementation of the pefile.py tool for static analysis of PE Binary files. Still very much a work in progress, and the code is gruesomely ugly. This really just started as a way to create imphashes in javascript, learning as I go.

A quick demo [here](https://cloudtracer.github.io/pefile.js/gh-pages/)
